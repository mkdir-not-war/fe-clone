1) Defeat is just as interesting as Victory -- each one leads to unique new
challenges and content.

2) Multiple objectives - choose which to prioritize and which to sacrifice if any

3) randomization of characters at the beginning for replayability
	^ what features of a character are randomized? 
	^ what features does a character have at all?

4) instead of grid combat a la D&D, do action/tactic combat like Assemble the Heroes
