<< no title screen, just load into main menu >>
1) MAIN MENU
	* CONTINUE [if any game saved]
		-> load game immediately, spawn character on map
	* NEW GAME
		-> new game menu
	* STATISTICS [if game finished at least once, any difficulty]
		-> stats page
	<< no way to delete stats in-game, must delete game data from system >>

2) NEW GAME MENU
	1) [if any game saved] Warning! This will overwrite current saved game.
	2) CHOOSE DIFFICULTY:
		* DISASTER (Easy)
		* CATACLYSM (Normal)
		* APOCALYPSE [must finish Cataclysm first]
			-> choose difficulty settings like Hades Pact of Punishment
				^^ one option maybe randomizes the city layout
	3) very short cutscene, maybe as simple as the player character walking up 
		into position on the first map, dialogue begins and auto-plays on side.
	4) playing the game!
