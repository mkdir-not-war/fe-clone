1) dodging in combat fills gauge - used to enhance abilities. Does not negate damage,
	otherwise positioning is meaningless, among other issues
2) start game choosing two characters. Start game with two characters. Unlock new characters
	by saving them in the world. Can play with them on *next* run.
3) consider 1 dungeon per region that allows you fight maps indefinitely to farm pokemon
	local to that region, but not farm skill points.
