* tiles are 32x32
* collision is a tile map -- each tile is made of four 16x16 collision squares,
	construct collision map from tile map on saving the tile map to map file.

** instead of using a separate tile sheet for animated tiles,
   just do them in rows of 4 (since the tilesheet is 8 wide,
   can fit 2 animated tiles per row). Like the int array of 
   tile indexes, have a bool array of animated or not (mostly not).
   If yes, sample from the next tile in the row on next frame.
 ^^ animated tiles are at the top of the tilesheet png,
    hard code how many rows are animated, don't display them
    in the tilepicker for static tiles

===== POKEMON ====
* every pokemon has three visible traits:
	1) A skill - can be slotted to replace a character skill
	2) A modifier - can be slotted to replace a character modifier (add effect to a skill)
	3) A passive - can be slotted to replace a character passive (applies to everything all the time)
* there is no way to replace the character's class ability (major passive -> modifies skills and passives)
	* character class ability makes the POSITION of nodes on the skill board matter somehow. 
		E.g. if I'm not using skill A or B, it should matter which one I replace with my Pokemon skill
				because their position on the board (and the pokemon skill position) matters to the class ability

** In Combat Attack Wheel **
	[OPTIONS: slot1, slot2, slot3, spiritslot1, spiritslot2, defend]
		^^ defend acts as both "move" and "pass", but allows directional blocking
		^^ defend only blocks attacks from that direction (from entities within the aoe of the "block attack")
		^^ defend cant grant armor or barrier cuz those aren't normally direction-based and that
			would be very confusing. So what does defend do? Is it unique per character? Maybe like a "charge"?
			Gain some kind of resource for every attack taken from an entity in the area?
