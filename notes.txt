* tiles are 32x32
* collision is a tile map -- each tile is made of four 16x16 collision squares,
	construct collision map from tile map on saving the tile map to map file.

** instead of using a separate tile sheet for animated tiles,
   just do them in rows of 4 (since the tilesheet is 8 wide,
   can fit 2 animated tiles per row). Like the int array of 
   tile indexes, have a bool array of animated or not (mostly not).
   If yes, sample from the next tile in the row on next frame.
 ^^ animated tiles are at the top of the tilesheet png,
    hard code how many rows are animated, don't display them
    in the tilepicker for static tiles

== QUESTIONS ===========================
========================================
1) should we EQUIP skills? Or do you have all skills available once unlocked, and no extras?
	- obviously it's fun and a goal to play the game again with the same character but different build
	  but should the build diversity come from the skill tree? Or can we lean into the pokemon?
2) should ACTIVATING or BREAKING shields take more turns? Which is harder to do/more situational?

===== SHIELDS & COMBAT CONDITIONS =====
* you can't damage enemies who have either a BARRIER or ARMOR until you break it.
* different enemy types gain BARRIER or ARMOR in different ways
	> e.g. fish shaman casts line spell and if it hits a player, the shaman and any adjacent units gain barrier

* SHIELDS:
	> ARMOR
		* breaks after two hits, allowing 3rd+ hits to damage the target. At the end of the turn, it reforms
		* when a target is CORNERED, its armor is broken and cannot reform
			> e.g. knock target into a corner, instantly CORNERED and armor breaks. If the target doesn't move
				out of the corner, their armor does not reform. If the target moves out of the corner, 
				they aren't CORNERED anymore (how to display the end of the condition?) and their armor reforms.
	> BARRIER
		* breaks when an entity is knocked into the target. At the end of the turn, it reforms
		* when a target is BURNING, its armor is broken and cannot reform

* CONDITIONS:
	> CORNERED
		* trigger: the target is adjacent to 2+ tiles that are impassable
	> BURNING
		* trigger: knock the target into a impassable tile with fire (1 turn), or proc'd with an attack effect

===== ENEMY TYPES =====
[not actual data, just a guide to design]
1) Skirmisher - low health, short range melee attack, one simple mechanic (e.g. can move extra tile after hit)
2) Sniper/Mage - low health, extremely long straight line range - coaxes the player closer
3) Bruiser - high health, wide range melee attack, slower movement
4) Enchanter - medium health, gives allies shields or healing after recognizable setup (can interrupt!)
5) Ambusher - medium health, high movement (obvious ways to stop them?), short range melee attack
* different enemy factions have 1+ type fitting into each archetype 
	e.g. fish have 2 different enchanters, cait sith have 2 different ambushers

===== POKEMON & SKILLS =====
* every character has 
* every pokemon has three visible traits:
	1) A skill - can be slotted to replace a character skill
	2) A modifier - can be slotted to replace a character modifier (add effect to a skill)
	3) A passive - can be slotted to replace a character passive (applies to everything all the time)
* there is no way to replace the character's keystone (major passive -> modifies skills and passives)
	* character keystone makes the POSITION of nodes on the skill board matter somehow. 
		E.g skills A and B are sword skills, skills C and D are axe skills. Even when spirit skill is slotted in,
			it's still sword/axe skills. Keystone boosts axe skills after sword skills and vice versa.

pokemon and skill tree overview:
	* In each combat, one enemy has an active skill granted by a randomly rolled spirit. 
		At the end of the combat, you can Exorcise or Capture the spirit.
	* keystone and skill#1 unlocked at level 1
	* unlock skills #2-5 by exorcising a spirit after combat
	* level a skill by Exorcising a spirit after combat
	* At level 2, can choose between 2 paths on the skill. Can swap path for free.
	* At level 2, skill gains a modifier, one per path
	* At level 3, skill gains a passive, one per path
	* When you Capture a spirit, you can slot it into any Skill, Modifier (on a single path) or Passive (")
		^^^ => 14 levels to max on each character -> 28 total.

===== REGIONS =====
* (rossbother), west end, the brass, the docks, the mud, the market, east end, the stays, downbull = 8 regions
* one enemy faction per area, ~6 enemy types per faction = 48 enemies (not including bosses)
* ~4 unique spirits per region, ~3 share spirits between regions = ~35 spirits = 35 skills!
